      <h3 class="display-4">AFM Local 47: The Original Website</h3>
      <br>
      <p>In my search for websites with poor design, I came across a website
        for a musicians union in Los Angeles. The first thought in my head was
        "I can't figure out the name of this organization." The next was "I
        don't really know what I should be clicking." And the third was "This 
        website looks like it might download a virus to my computer." No offense 
        to the original designers.
      </p>

      <img class="img-fluid" src="images/ogwebsite3.png" alt="screenshot of original website, three of three">
      <p>The original site can be accessed <a href="https://afm47.org/">here</a>.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="usetext">
      <h3 class="display-4">Design Criteria</h3>
      <p>In analyzing the design of an interface, we fall back into three main categories:
        usability, learnability, and memorability. Additionally, we want to look at the 
        accessibility of this website.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="designcriteria" id="designcrit">
      <div class="usability">
        <h4>Usability</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Flat buttons, unsure of how to interact with them</li>
          <li>Immediate bombardment with information makes it hard to know where to go first</li>
          <li>One of the images in the grid doesn't change color on hover even though it is a button</li>
          <li>Social media icons and log in buttons are hard to find</li>
          <li>Locations for some items are in very unintuitive places on the site</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="learnability">
        <h4>Learnability</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Everything is sorted into fitting categories</li>
          <li>More link bombardment - a few categories in the navigation bar have way too many subcategories</li>
          <li>Easy to forget that pictures in the big grid have their own links too</li>
          <li>Member resources category is LOADED</li>
          <li>Navigating back to the home page is somewhat unclear</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="memorability">
        <h4>Memorability</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Text hierarchies make it unclear what the name of the company is until you go to the About Us page</li>
          <li>Homepage looks very much like a spam website due to less spacing and a ton of links </li>
          <li>The appearance is very similar to a blog website as opposed to a music and employment union website</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="accessibility">
        <h4>Accessibility</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>WAVE tool detects many contrast issues with text color against background</li>
          <li>Some of the images do not have alt text</li>
          <li>Some of the buttons are made of images, and they don't have alt-text, so knowing the function of the button could be difficult</li>
          <li>Screen readers have a hard time being able to read the buttons on the website</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    

      <div class="judgement">
        <h4>Overall Judgement of Original Website</h4>
        <p>The website has a consistent color theme and responsive content, suggesting that some thought 
          was certainly put into the aesthetic appearance of the website. However, it is not enough from a 
          functional standpoint. Visitors to this website will be bombarded with a million links, with none 
          looking tempting enough to click and all of the units together resembling more of a spam-type website 
          than an organization. The navigation and interactions at some part of this website are very odd. 
          Additionally, there is very minimal effort put into accessibility, with color contrast being a key issue, 
          as well as important buttons being made from images and not having alt text. Overall, it is a decent 
          website that I wouldn’t hate using if I was a member of the musicians’ union, but does not draw new 
          visitors in and is not very engaging even for returning users. The design of the website is very plain 
          and flat, and in my redesign I want to aim to make this website a lot cleaner, more accessible, and more 
          interactive-feeling.</p>

    <div class="lofi" id="lofi">
      <h3 class="display-4">Lo-fi Markups</h3>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/web-lofi-anno.png" alt="annotated lo-fi prototype of the website on browser">
        </div>
        <div class="col align-self-center">
          <p>To create my markups, I used Balsamiq to layout all of my elements and get an idea of 
            how I wanted things to be placed on the website. The idea with this layout is that spacing
            allows for the existence of hierarchy and easier navigation on the website.

        <div class="w-100"></div>
        <div class="col align-self-center">
          <p>The biggest challenge in responsive redesign is having to think about how my layouts will 
            work for different devices. Across screen sizes, the appearance of my site may vary as a 
            result of ratioed sizing and limited space. As a result, I had to put in a lot of time 
            considering how the size of the viewing screen would impact the way this layout would work.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">

        </div>
        <div class="col align-self-center">
          <p>The most fundamental changes, from what was planned in the lo-fi stage, would occur at 
            two main places: the navigation bar and the quick navigation buttons. Navigation bars will be
            hard to tap on and see on a smaller screen, so at a mobile screen size, I want to switch over 
            from a navigation bar that stretches across the width of the screen into a hamburger menu that 
            can be tapped on by a user to reveal the menu. As for the quick navigation, the biggest thing here 
            will be to figure out how to wrap my buttons in a logical way.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col align-self-center">
          <p>The color scheme displayed on these screens comes partly from the main blue on the logo of the 
            site, as well as the warm-tone of the "Pay Dues" button on the original website. I chose a more 
            rounded font, rounded button style, and these light colors to add an element of brightness to the 
            site, making it more engaging for users.

        </div>
        <div class="col align-self-center">
          <p>In order to make the website appear less flat than before, I decided to have shadows and hover 
            actions on each button as a signal to the user to click. Keeping the city theme of the website in 
            mind, I also went with a header photo of LA but in the daytime to keep with the theme of the new 
            colors and to keep a theme of modernity.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col align-self-center">
          <p>In creating hi-fi prototypes, I recognized that wrapping each section in a div container was 
            the best way to go about keeping a clean, sleek design and create an obvious hierarchy. I decided 
            that I would make use of grid layouts in my design, because they will keep the layout of my buttons 
            very organized. While these prototypes depict only one part of my design, the major ideas were all 
            laid out in front of me, ready to be coded.

          <h4>Changes from Prototypes</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The implementation of the hamburger menu bar, with the way I wanted it, required a lot of javascript I was 
                uncomfortable with. While I did try to push as far as I could with new things to learn in this project, I ended 
                up prioritizing my time with accessibility and visibility concerns instead.
              </li>
              <li>In my prototypes, I used a light blue background color that matched that of the logo, along with white text. 
                However, the contrast between these colors was too low, so I darkened the background color.
              </li>
              <li>I borrowed a little from the original website and extended on my original design by adding the grid-format 
                orange column panels just before the footer. Thnking about the company itself, I came to the conclusion that 
                they would want to encourage donating and giving money to offer support, since they are a labor union. I kept the 
                idea of the columns but added my own tweaks to make them more engaging and responsive.
              </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h4>Overall Changes from Original</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Buttons with box shadows and hover colors to encourage interactiveness</li>
              <li>Menu bar looks different on tablet/phone than on browser, for ease of use.</li>
              <li>Website search higher on the page for direct navigation</li>
              <li>Better hierarchy of items to make purpose and structure clear</li>
              <li>Changed picture and theme colors to have a more coherent theme</li>
              <li>More cleaned-up, minimalistic design</li>
              <li>Better color contrast on page</li>
              <li>Responsive fonts, boxes, icons, buttons, etc</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h4>Self-Evaluation</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>According to WAVE, the single error on this site was the dummy search and lack of any link to other sites, 
                but this was intentional for the purposes of the assignment.</li>
              <li>The only other issues WAVE pointed out was to external links leading to original website.</li>
              <li>There are many things I wasn't fully conscious of when I was designing, leading me to redoing multiple aspects
                of the site mainly for accessiblity concerns - this seems like some sort of internal bias we as designers need to
                learn to hone in on better.</li>
              <li>Prototyping was extremely, EXTREMELY helpful, as I was able to save time by coding the things I knew was 
                going to be on the page, so I could spend more of my time on debugging.</li>
              <li>I also became more conscious of design on the user end as well - thinking about it, I went with such a rounded
                look for my redesign because it felt more interactive, which I believe several other companies in the tech industry 
                have done with their own product redesigns as well.</li>
